# M2M Job Board Application

This is a job board application built for **M2M**, designed to streamline the internal recruitment process within the company. It allows employees to view job postings, apply for open positions, and stay up-to-date with new opportunities within the organization.

The application was built during my internship and utilizes Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data management.

## Features 🚀

- 📋 **Job Listings**: View available job positions within M2M, including job title, description, and requirements.
- 📝 **Apply for Jobs**: Employees can apply to job positions directly within the app, and the application is sent via email.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- 📧 **Email Notifications**: Email confirmation and notifications are sent when a job application is submitted.
